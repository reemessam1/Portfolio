# Consortia Management System (CMS) with initial prototype – SWE216 Project

**Course**: Software Requirements Engineering (SWE-216)  KFUPM

---

##  Project Overview

The **Consortia Management System (CMS)** is an enterprise-level software solution developed to streamline and automate the lifecycle of research collaborations between KFUPM and its industry partners. The system centralizes communication, simplifies research proposal workflows, and ensures compliance, documentation, and communication traceability.

---

##  Objective

To define, analyze, design the initial prototype, and validate a fully functional and scalable requirement specification for a web-based system that:
- Facilitates submission and evaluation of research proposals
- Supports agreement management and tracking
- Enhances transparency between researchers, consortium directors, legal teams, and external partners
- Minimizes manual processes and operational costs

---

##  Key Features

-  Secure authentication via KFUPM's official login system
-  Submission and review of research proposals
-  Consortium agreement management
-  Central communication channel with chat, voice, and video call support
-  Dashboard for project tracking and notifications
-  Document traceability, versioning, and backups
-  Scalable for up to 500 concurrent users

---

## My Role

### Contributions:
- Participated in identifying and prioritizing system requirements through multiple iterations
- Helped conduct stakeholder analysis and write traceability matrices
- Contributed to requirement validation and verification through simulations and walkthroughs
- Co-developed **high-fidelity UI prototypes** for key system interfaces using Figma
- Ensured that designs met user stories, system goals, and accessibility guidelines

## Prototypes (UI)

> Developed to simulate the system’s interaction flow and verify requirements

### ✅ Version 1:
- **Home Page** – Displays CMS overview and partners
- **Projects Page** – Lists active projects with details on sponsors and researchers
- **Research Proposal Submission Page** – Form for submitting research ideas
- **Project Dashboard Page** – Shows project progress and color-coded notifications

### ✅ Version 2 (Post-validation improvements):
- **Project Dashboard (Improved)** – Includes pie chart, bar chart, deadlines, and real-time updates
- **Active Projects Page** – Allows users to view and access documents, team members, and tasks
- **Communication Channel Page** – Enables chat, audio/video calls, and shared documents
- **Tasks Page** – Tracks project task progress with descriptions and attachments
