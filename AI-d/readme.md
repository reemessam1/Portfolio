#  AI-d – Real-Time AI-Powered First Aid Assistant  
**Hackathon Project – UCL & KFUPM Solution Hackathon**  
  *Second Place Winner*

##  Project Overview

**AI-d** is an AI-powered first aid assistant designed to guide users in emergency situations through voice, text, and visual instructions. It provides real-time, accessible, and trusted first aid guidance based on official Ministry of Health documentation.

Our mission was to help people confidently perform life-saving actions during emergencies, especially when professional help is not immediately available.

##  Problem Statement

Many bystanders hesitate to perform first aid due to fear, stress, or lack of training. Traditional resources like manuals or YouTube videos are not effective in high-stress, real-time scenarios.

##  Proposed Solution

**AI-d** assists users by:
- Taking quick input about the emergency.
- Delivering voice-guided and visual step-by-step help.
- Providing emergency contacts and automatically locating nearby medical centers.
- Using only *Ministry of Health*-approved information for safe and accurate advice.
